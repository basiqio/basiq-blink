# Blink drop in control


## Installing
To run the package you should have nodemon installed

```npm i -g nodemon```

```npm install```

## Running

Because the node server listens to the port 80 you need to run
index.js using an account with elevated priviledges or using sudo

```sudo nodemon index.js```

The app should listen to port 80 and everything should work.
